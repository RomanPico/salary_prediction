'''
Here we define some functions that perform EDA on the given datasets. This module includes two kind of functions:
- Functions that check the datasets for inconsistencies or null values. The idea is to verify the integrity of the given datasets.
- Functions that helps to visualize the datasets. The idea is to plot different variables and see how is their structure.

The idea of the first group of functions is to guide  us to create a preprocessing module to clean the datasets. In future versions the idea
is to enhance the preprocessing module so we can not just delete all the rows wilth null values, but replace them with different values (following logical rules, of course).

The second group of functions will help us to understand the data and how its different categories relate and how to preprocess the data. As a first step, it was found that
    the Salary column is not normally distributed, so we will use the log of the Salary column to make it more normally distributed. In future versions, the idea is to find
    correlations between other variables and see if we can use a better method that one shot encoding.
