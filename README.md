# Salary Forecast V0.1

This proyect consist in a machine learning model for predicting the salary of a person. This is done using different variables like Age, education, job position and years of experience.

The main idea in the whole project is to build a simple but functional pipeline, flexible enought to include different features in future versions.

The project is structure in the following way:

- `main.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook where we load the data, train the model, and visualize the results.

- `src/`: Contains all the modular code used in the project:
  - `eda.py`: Performs exploratory data analysis on both the raw and cleaned datasets. This module is optional â€” the code runs fine without it. It has two parts: one for inspecting the original dataset and another for generating plots.
  - `preprocessing.py`: Data loading and cleaning
  - `features.py`: Transformation of categorical variables
  - `model.py`: Model training, evaluation, and performance metrics

- `data/`: Contains the original CSVs and an example file for batch predictions

- `README.md`: This file
- `requirements.txt`: Libraries needed to run this code.


 _Intended Initial Features_

- Load and clean the dataset using simple heuristics (drop rows with missing values)
- Perform optional exploratory data analysis (EDA) including null inspection and variable distributions
- Transform features: one-hot encoding for categorical variables and log-transform for the target (Salary)
- Train a baseline predictive model using linear regression (Scikit-learn)
- Evaluate the model using MAE and RMSE
- Report 95% confidence intervals for the metrics using bootstrap resampling
- Compare model performance against a DummyRegressor (mean prediction)

 _Future Improvements_

- Add support for more sophisticated models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Improve missing data handling instead of dropping rows (e.g., imputation based on correlated variables)
